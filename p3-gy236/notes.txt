CPSC 4270 â€“ Programming Assignment 3
NetID: gy236

This submission contains:
- Card.hpp / Card.cpp: Modified to use 0-based indexing, removed "bad", switched to array and .at() for runtime checking.
- Deck.hpp / Deck.cpp: Implements a Spider deck of 104 cards, shuffle(), and print() to output 13 cards per line. Modified to include a deal() function. 
- Pile.hpp / Pile.cpp: Implements a Pile class, keeping track of the number of cards face down and the number of cards in the pile.
- Board.hpp / Board.cpp: Implements a Board class that consists of 10 piles and a stock deck.
- main.cpp: Test driver. Reads seed from command line, shuffles the deck, and prints the board. Uses banner() and bye() from tools library.
- main.cpp: Runtest driver. Reads script file (first line seed), then executes commands.
- tools.hpp / tools.cpp: Provided utility library (unchanged except included here for completeness).

Command to compile and clean executable files:
make, make clean

Build and run:
make
./runtest [TEST_SCRIPT_NAME].txt

Example if you want to save the output to a file:
./runtest tests/test_errors.txt &> out_errors.output // &> to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same file

Sample output and test files are in the outputs and tests folder respectively.
