CPSC 4270 â€“ Programming Assignment 1
NetID: gy236

This submission contains:
- Card.hpp / Card.cpp: Modified to use 0-based indexing, removed "bad", switched to std::array and .at() for runtime checking.
- Deck.hpp / Deck.cpp: Implements a Spider deck of 104 cards, shuffle(), and print() to output 13 cards per line.
- main.cpp: Test driver. Reads seed from command line, prints initial deck, shuffles, and prints shuffled deck. Uses banner() and bye() from tools library.
- tools.hpp / tools.cpp: Provided utility library (unchanged except included here for completeness).

This is the command I used on my machine to compile the program:
g++ -std=c++20 main.cpp Deck.cpp Card.cpp tools.cpp -o main

User just needs to provide a seed as a command line argument to run the program.
