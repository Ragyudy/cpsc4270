CPSC 4270 â€“ Programming Assignment 2
NetID: gy236

This submission contains:
- Card.hpp / Card.cpp: Modified to use 0-based indexing, removed "bad", switched to array and .at() for runtime checking.
- Deck.hpp / Deck.cpp: Implements a Spider deck of 104 cards, shuffle(), and print() to output 13 cards per line. Modified to include a deal() function. 
- Pile.hpp / Pile.cpp: Implements a Pile class, keeping track of the number of cards face down and the number of cards in the pile.
- Board.hpp / Board.cpp: Implements a Board class that consists of 10 piles and a stock deck.
- main.cpp: Test driver. Reads seed from command line, shuffles the deck, and prints the board. Uses banner() and bye() from tools library.
- tools.hpp / tools.cpp: Provided utility library (unchanged except included here for completeness).

Command to compile and clean executable files:
make, make clean
I tried making a command that takes in a target executable "testboard" and a seed input, but settled on just keeping it simple as this program is simple enough.

User just needs to provide a seed as a command line argument to run the program.
e.g., ./main 123

test output:
